# Utah-Housing-Market

This project consists of completely original data that was scraped from DHomes4you.com. The site is used by many real estate agents to keep track of all current listings
in Utah. The data was scraped in late June 2022.

The files included in this repository will take you through 3 important processes: 
1) The Python code I wrote in order to scrape the data into a usable csv format.
2) The data cleaning process in Python using the Pandas library.
3) Initial correlations visualized in Python using the Pandas, Seaborn & Matplotlib libraries.

The final piece to this project is a visualization/dashboard of the results which can be found at the link below.
